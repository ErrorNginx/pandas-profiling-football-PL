# Pandas Profiling
> About pandas Profiling

pandas-profiling 

pandas-profiling generates profile reports from a pandas DataFrame. The pandas df.describe() function is handy yet a little basic for exploratory data analysis. pandas-profiling extends pandas DataFrame with df.profile_report(), which automatically generates a standardized univariate and multivariate report for data understanding.
